        <a href="https://help.This app.com/This app-feedback/all-about-This app-feedback/" target="_blank">This app Feedback Collection and Fraud Detection Policy</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Scope</b></p>
            <p>
                This policy document covers the philosophy, intent and methodology used by This app to collect Feedback from Patients about Doctors and other Practitioners who are part of the This app eco-system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Philosophy and Intent</b></p>
            <p>
                At This app, we believe in transparency and authenticity, and these are the 2 primary pillars on which the Feedback collection system is built. We intend to help Patients make a well-informed decision when it comes to their Health and authentic Feedback helps them achieve that. Doctors being This app’s closest friends throughout our successful journey, would be the other beneficiary, with authentic Feedback circulating in the Patient circles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>How we collect Feedback</b></p>
            <p>As of now This app endeavors to reach out to the following group of authentic Patients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Patients who have booked appointments through This app.com:</b> This app reaches out to these Patients via SMS/E-mail within 3 days after their scheduled appointment schedule and ask them for Feedback on their appointment experience at the Clinic with the Doctor. This app has complete ownership of this flow of feedback collection since This app is responsible for giving the best experience to patients booking an appointment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Patients who have booked appointments with Doctors who use This app Ray:</b> In this scenario, This app seeks prior permission from the Owner of the This app Ray-enabled practice to collect feedback from Patients whose appointments have been booked by the practice using This app Ray. This app then reaches out to these Patients via SMS/E-mail within 3 days after their scheduled appointment schedule. Please note that This app can only ask Patients for Feedback if the practice Owner has permitted This app to do the same, and any Feedback collected thereafter becomes a property of This app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Patients who have booked appointments with Doctors who use the This app Tab:</b> The This app Tab has an in-built feedback module to collect patient feedback after their appointment. This app seeks prior permission from the Owner of the This app Tab to share this feedback with This app. This app then sends an auto-generated SMS to patients to obtain consent for sharing the feedback. The patient must give a missed call to the listed number within 24 hrs of receiving the SMS, to ensure that the Feedback is reflected on This app Search.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The This app Feedback system is built such that it limits the number of SMS and emails that are sent to a particular patient to ‘one-every-month’ even if he/she books more than one appointment with you during the period. This ensures sufficient cool-off period between subsequent Feedback from the same patient and a much more robust and fair feedback model.It is also important to note that Patients who happen to book appointments via This app* with a This app Ray-enabled Doctor/Clinic would fall in category (1) mentioned above.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Nature of Feedback</b></p>
            <p>
                The This app Feedback Collection System currently asks Patients about their appointment experience. The information collected would primarily be categorized as below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Doctor recommendation – whether the patient would recommend the doctor to his/her friends and family
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wait-time – how long the patient had to wait for his/her appointment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Doctor Feedback – Patient’s testimonial about appointment experience with the Doctor
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Authenticity of Feedback Collection</b></p>
            <p>
                As part of our efforts to collect and display authentic Feedback, This app abides by these set of rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A Patient would be probed with SMS/E-mail for Feedback on an appointment with a Doctor only once in a month
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Patient cannot give multiple Feedback for a single appointment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Appointments booked via This app includes (but not restricted to) appointments from the following sources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Doctor and Practice profile on This app.com or smartphone apps
                        </li>

                        </li>

                    <p><b>Intent</b></p>
                    An online healthcare ecosystem of This app’s magnitude sees a large number of Patients giving Feedback about their Appointment experience on a daily basis. Given the volume of Feedback entering the This app’s Feedback Collection System we consider it very important to make sure only the helpful and authentic feedback reach out to the Patients who visit This app.com and assist them in their Patient experience.

                <li>
                    <p><b>Helpful and authentic Feedback</b></p>
                    A helpful and authentic Feedback is one that complies with This app Feedback Standards and other information points probed by This app Feedback Collection System, and more importantly, is submitted by an authentic user.
                    <p>Some of the Feedback we do not entertain on This app are:</p>
                    <ul class="lower-rom-list">
                        <li>
                            Feedback that is 3-worded or less – we have observed that they don’t help patients looking for insightful patient experiences
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feedback that tends to have ulterior motives – advertising, spam, abuse, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Moderation team</b></p>
                    <p>
                        We have a team of moderators that examine questionable Feedback. We also use automated tools on the site that help flag questionable content for review and we are working on enabling our large and passionate community of millions of users keep an eye out as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moderation team would be responsible for screening the Feedback posted by Patients abiding by This app Feedback Standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Feedback is evaluated as a whole while moderating – e.g. A Feedback that happens to start with relevant information and ends up with statements that do not comply with This app Feedback Standards would not be published. A moderator can take the following generic stances on any incoming Feedback:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="lower-rom-list">
                        <li>Publish</li>

                    <p>
                        The majority of Feedback is posted within 48 hours of submission. If a Feedback is flagged for a closer look by our moderators, it may take longer, especially during our busiest days. We try to base every decision we make on what our members will find helpful and relevant. At times, Feedback under investigation may take several weeks to process.

                    <p>
                        As long as Feedback meets our guidelines, we’re happy to post it whether it’s positive or negative. The majority of our Feedback is indeed positive, and we do not influence or change the content.

            <p>
                Misusing or manipulating Feedback systems for personal benefit is the last thing This app would want to entertain on the This app Feedback System. This app has come up with its own standards and processes to detect Fraud and deal with them in the appropriate manner.

                <li>
                    Attempts by a Doctor to damage his/her competitors by submitting negative feedback.

            <h5><span class="item-no">1. </span>Bottom Line:</h5>Any attempt to mislead, influence or impersonate a Patient is considered fraudulent and will be subject to penalty.

            <h5><span class="item-no">2. </span>Detecting fraud</h5>Unfortunately we are unable to disclose the specifics of our Fraud Detection System.

We have quality assurance specialists who have brought a wide range of professional experience to enhance our prevention methods and our team spends thousands of hours every year ensuring the integrity of Feedback on This app. We also use automated tools that help flag questionable content for review, and very soon we will enable our large and passionate community of users to keep an eye out as well.

            <h5><span class="item-no">3. </span>Repercussions of being fraudulent</h5>If we determine that there is fraudulent Feedback submitted for a Doctor/Clinic , there could be several consequences:
            <ul>
                <li>A fraudulent heath-care entity might not be the right choice for a Patient. So a Doctor/Clinic may drop by several points in the This app index.</li>
                <li>
                We are working on putting up a penalty notice, explaining that the feedback about Doctor/Clinic is suspicious, and this may appear on the listing page.

        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><span class="item-no">4. </span>Legal side of fraudulent reviews</h5>In addition to being a violation of our terms of service and an unethical practice, this is also a violation of the law in many jurisdictions. In July 2009, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo settled a case which resulted in a $300,000 penalty for a company posting fake consumer reviews. It is also illegal to post fake reviews in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany, Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands (among other countries) pursuant to the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, adopted by these countries.
